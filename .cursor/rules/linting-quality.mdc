# Linting and Quality

- Prefer ESLint with TypeScript rules. To analyze this project run: `eslint main.ts` or `eslint ./src/` if sources live there.
- Fix linter errors before committing. Do not suppress rules unless justified.
- Keep public APIs typed explicitly; avoid implicit any.
- Keep changes minimal and scoped; avoid unrelated refactors in the same edit.
