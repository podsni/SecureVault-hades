# Obsidian Plugin Guidelines

- Default to local/offline. Only make network calls for explicit, user-visible features with clear disclosure and opt-in.
- No telemetry by default. If optional analytics or third-party calls exist, document in `README.md` and settings, and require explicit opt-in.
- Never execute remote code or auto-update outside official releases. Bundle all deps into `main.js`.
- Access only necessary data within the vault; never touch files outside the vault.
- Register and clean up all listeners/intervals using `this.register*` helpers for safe unload.
- Keep startup light; defer heavy work until needed. Debounce expensive file system responses.
- Add commands with stable IDs via `this.addCommand(...)`. Provide sensible defaults and a settings tab if configuration exists.
- Ensure mobile compatibility unless `isDesktopOnly` is `true`. Avoid Node/Electron-only APIs.
